        By law, all applicants need GCSE grade C/grade 4, or an equivalent, in English and Mathematics - plus Science for Primary courses.
      </p>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        Candidates may still be taking a GCSE when they apply. Alternatively, they can take an equivalency test to demonstrate they have the required skills to start a course.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        The codes you pick determine how flexible you are towards those candidates.
